Assignment 1 Description
This assignment is about using python fundamentals to create a student gradebook management system. The first parts of the assignment showcase the different python data types and functions as well as their usage. The remainder of the assignment uses Pandas, a python library for data management, to analyze student data. The average GPA for each student in each homeroom will be calculated using English and Math grades. The data will also be organized based on grade and homeroom and will be displayed by creating plots. The last part of this assignment applies least square estimation.
